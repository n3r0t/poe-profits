## Setting up local development

### Prerequisites

A local development environment with the server side code running is required. The server side code can be found [here](https://github.com/sjohan99/poe-profit-calc/api).

### Environment Variables

- Make a copy of the file [`.env.example`](.env.example) as `.env.development` and populate the variables if necessary.

### Running the app

- Run `pnpm install` (or your prefered package manager) to install the dependencies.
- Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server.
